# ðŸ¤– CS 270 Machine Learning Labs â€“ Winter 2025

This repository contains a collection of hands-on lab assignments completed for **CS 270: Machine Learning** at **Brigham Young University (Winter 2025)**. Each notebook explores core machine learning concepts through implementation and experimentation using Python and Google Colab.

## ðŸ§ª Included Labs

- `perceptron_lab.ipynb` â€“ Binary classification using the Perceptron algorithm.
- `backpropagation_lab.ipynb` â€“ Manual implementation of backpropagation in neural networks.
- `decision_tree_lab.ipynb` â€“ Building decision trees from scratch for classification tasks.
- `knn_lab.ipynb` â€“ Applying the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm.
- `clustering_lab.ipynb` â€“ Exploring unsupervised learning with K-Means clustering.
- `q_learning_lab.ipynb` â€“ Reinforcement learning using Q-learning in a grid environment.

## ðŸ“Ž Notes
All labs were written and tested in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Each notebook is self-contained with explanations and visualizations.
